Moving from the in-line analysis and into phase 3, the in-depth analysis, we will be analysing our findings in such way that we will be able to improve the platform according to the target users’ needs and problems. We will achieve this by performing user study analyses which are processed using ethnographic tools, followed by idea development based on these findings.
