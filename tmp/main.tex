\section{Background}
In this report we will present our results of the gathered data from patients with diabetes. However, due to the Covid-19 we have faced a few challenges in regard to the desired in-situ interviews with the target group. For example, instead of in-situ interviews we have shifted over to a more quantitative approach in form of surveys. Nonetheless, these surveys have also provided us with novel problems and needs which we did not observe in our first qualitative interview.\\

Moving from the in-line analysis and into phase 3, the in-depth analysis, we will be analysing our findings in such a way that we will be able to improve the platform according to the target users’ needs, problems and requests. We will achieve this by performing user study analyses which are processed using ethnographic tools, followed by idea development based on these findings.

\section{Goals, problems and needs}

\subsection{Goals}
The goals for the expansion of the platform is overall to improve how data is processed and accessed; e.g. improving the way test results are displayed, adding a calendar to gain overview, making a contact list to facilitate easy contact, etc.
By understanding the perspective that the target group presents in their day to day interaction with the platform, we experience numerous problems and needs. These are things that have a significant influence on the use of the \textit{MinSP} for most users.

\section{MoSCoW}
%Udkast til afsnit, kom gerne med ændringer
Analyzing the data gathered from interviews and surveys we could construct user stories that we use to create the following MoSCoW model.

The most frequent topics from user stories are used to place them into the MoSCoW model.
