Moving from the in-line analysis and into phase 3, the in-depth analysis, we will be analysing our findings in such a way that we will be able to improve the platform according to the target usersâ€™ needs, problems and requests. We will achieve this by performing user study analyses which are processed using ethnographic tools, followed by idea development based on these findings.
